I worked with:
Emily Guggenhiem (Sophomore at Chapman)
James Kistner (Sophomore at Chapman)
Jeremy Anderson (Frosh at Chapman)

Problems:
I couldn't figure out how to maintain the whitespace in-between words in my decrypted and encrypted files. Also, my hp.txt would lose it's formating when put into my encrypted file. 

I would like to use a late day for this assignment.
This is my second late assignment of the semester.
